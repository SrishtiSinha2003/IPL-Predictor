### IPL-PREDICTOR
Predicts which team to win in a match based on the number of runs left, overs left, wickets left and also a key role of the stadium.

I have used pandas, numpy, scikit-learn libraries to make this model in colab.

Further built the web app in streamlit through pycharm and deploying it in streamlit cloud
